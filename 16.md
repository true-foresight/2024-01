## This Is Me Being Neutral

At some point in the near future, the Canadian police called Waterloo Regional Police Services (WRPS) will claim that they were parked outside my house the whole night, and then continuing into the morning of a particular day, during the last week of March-2020, to make sure that I was feeling safe in my home, given that previously, there was a reported incident of home invasion at my house. They will say that all of the incidents where agents gained illegal entry into my home during my absence, and those involving the WRPS, including the ones where they followed me on the street in their WRPS patrol car, while I was walking, at the same walking pace just behind me, were utterly untrue or fabricated by me. 

In claiming that they were only trying to do their job and following "Standard Operating Procedures", they wouldn't exactly be lying; they were merely trying to make sure that my family and I were sufficiently terrorized and frightened, to keep our mouths shut and heads down, and for me to not post anything online about corruption within the ranks of Canadian policing agencies. They certainly did not want me to speak to any persons about things like portions of $64 million CAD for a new police headquarters in Kitchener being misappropriated by the City of Kitchener, by circumventing the necessary work permits, public hearings, and procedures, pertaining to Request For Proposal in hiring contractors to do the construction work at 200 Frederick Street, Kitchener, Ontario. Corrupt officials will claim that it is entirely within the Waterloo Region's and Ontario government's discretion to not follow their own statutory rules and regulations, in matters concerning the commissioning and construction of public works. 

They also, most certainly didn't want to, and still don't want me to speak up about WRPS officers harassing homeless youth shelter residents at what used to be known as oneRoof, which was located at 262 Queen Street South, Kitchener, Ontario. WRPS officers repeatedly and systematically kept harassing those youth, after which the shelter was evacuated with fewer residents wanting to seek shelter or to be there. And then, oneRoof was forced to relocate to a far off and inaccessible location, away from the main areas of the city, so that a construction company could take over the land at 262 Queen Street South, only to construct a privately owned apartment building. The way dirty and corrupt police officers had colluded with local landlords in Kitchener, to chase away homeless or orphaned youth from a shelter, to then have the shelter demolished and converted into a lucrative commercial venture, was not going to be a flattering piece of news for the city's council members and the mayor, nor for the governor of Ontario. 

Subsequently, making sure that I could instead be framed as a violently psychotic Muslim Arab with delusions and connections to mercenaries, to then be [illegitimately detained and tortured](https://github.com/true-hindsight/grim-realities/tree/main/disclosed) by state-sponsored agencies, was done using every tax-payer funded resources available to Canadian public service units that coordinated with WRPS. I am not an Arab, nor am I any of the things they fabricated against me, to have me illegally arrested, and to have then caused me to suffer sexual and reproductive harms. The police along with their coordinating agencies in Kitchener-Waterloo region, will attempt to shore up umpteen ways of denying or deflecting the serious allegations being leveled here, and most certainly, they have already orchestrated a rather convenient way of discrediting me and assassinating my character. 

However, when they will attempt to "strongly object" and to take "umbrage", with such publicly viewable articles of a whistle blower, they will be required to prove that police officer Heaton and his partner from the week of May-2020 who had interacted with me, both, passed their police entrance exams and obtained their other qualifications, without cheating. They will need to do so, on the pains of committing perjury. The WRPS, along with the Ontario judiciary, will need to defend the wrongdoings of Justice Ziegler who authorized and signed off on the paperwork for my illegitimate detention; also, under the pains of, committing perjury. 

It was only inevitable, that publicly funded institutes as well as private organizations in Canada, that have been systematically colluding to conduct surreptitious acts of molestation, harassment, murder, and genocidal activities, against targeted minorities and peoples of color, were going to bump into a person like myself. I am not the first person to have been wronged and murderously harmed by public service units and their affiliates, within Canada, nor am I among the last of the people being systematically profiled and then targeted by them. That unfortunately, is going to remain the sad and true nature of Canadian society, especially in places like Kitchener, Ontario, for years to come. 

Worst of all, at this point in time, the Canadian Federal Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, does not seem to appreciate direct, open, and honest lines of communication, particularly the lines of communication that have remained unambiguous, without fanfare, and without any form of deceit or equivocation, and also non-hostile, although neutral and not exactly friendly.

By the way, I had mentioned the name that my friends call me, to the patron operating the barber shop known as "The Walper Barbers", located on 119 Joseph St, Kitchener, ON N2G 1J3, Canada. I am going to guess, that should certain Canadian agencies try to retrieve that information about what my friends call me, those barbers' memories will need to be refreshed and jogged a little. So, try asking them about a tall brown guy who had insisted for a clean shave with a razor edge, a few years ago, which the person running the business had to oblige to providing, even though he had claimed to have never used a straight shaving razor. It was, one of the most steady and skilled hands with a straight razor I have ever experienced. Also, it became much more calm and peaceful, when his superiors came to the barber shop to watch him give me a shave, after making all other customers and workers leave, and then closing the shop for the day, with just me and them sitting silently, while the barber performed his duties. I must say, it was a very personalized form of service that I received, and for no extra cost. 

If, for some reason, those agencies are unable to retrieve the necessary information from The Walper Barbers at Joseph Street, then, those agencies may need to find and make my friends, give them that information. 

So yes, those agencies will need to insist on obtaining that information from the particular barber at Joseph Street in Kitchener, similar to the way I had to insist that a person who had shaved the heads and beards of recruits sent to join the Canadian military, thousands of times during the course of the past two decades, to stop lying to me about having never handled a straight razor. This is simply because, without that piece of information about my real name, there will be no scope for ever being friends again. 

Also, people like me, and I, are not the enemy of Canada or any other country, contrary to what the proprietors of The Walper Barbers would have their young children believe; and despite the clandestine hostility and animosity being directed by various state-sponsored organizations and their members incubated in Canada, towards my diaspora and those like myself. 

The most unfortunate forecast I have for this year, is that the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) won't be able to find the members of the para-military organization having the insignia of Nabla Kappa Kappa, which had invaded my home in Kitchener during Fall-2019. Those policing agencies along with their intelligence units will say that it's a foregone cold case and that they have had "no credible leads" to pursue it. And, expecting the WRPS to go after those vile home invaders was entirely counter productive as well as problematic, due to the fact that the WRPS decided to pathologize, hurt, and then willfully harm the family whose home was invaded by malicious agents operating within Ontario, Canada, with impunity. 

Similar to thousands of other cold cases from the past seven decades where minorities, persons of color or First Nations Peoples have been devastatingly harmed or injured, by vile individuals and organizations in Canada, the due justice owed to my family and me will also be sidelined, only to perpetuate the culture of racism and bigotry that still plagues various Canadian institutes. 
   
Eventually though, the Canadian governments at the provincial and federal levels will realize that they will need to genuinely put an end to, and to pay for all the wrongs and disservice being committed by their agents and agencies, because the only alternative option for those institutes and agencies, is to pay.
